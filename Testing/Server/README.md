# Server Test
Tests to make sure the server works as intended.

## Test Client
Simulates POST requests that would be sent by the De1-SoC, POST requests sent by the app, and GET requests sent by the 
app. Run with `python3 -u <URL>`, where URL could be something like `http://localhost:8000` or `http://www.example.com`.
