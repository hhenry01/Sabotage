# Sabotage

## Branch naming convention

Branch naming convention: **type**-**issueID**-**desc**

**type**: Used to identify the purpose of this branch. The different types have been listed below:

- wip - works in progress; stuff I know won't be finished soon
- feat - feature I'm adding or expanding
- bug - bug fix or experiment
- junk - throwaway branch created to experiment

**issueID**: This is a unique Id that identifies each issue. Can be found next to the issue name (Number that is preceded by a ‘#’).

Note: Use three digits numbers eg: #7 would be 007

**desc**: a short description about the issue. If two or more words are needed, use ‘\_’ to separate them.
